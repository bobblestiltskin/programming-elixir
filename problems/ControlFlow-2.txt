We now have three different implementations of FizzBuzz. One uses cond,
one uses case, and one uses separate functions with guard clauses.
Take a minute to look at all three. Which do you feel best expresses the
problem. Which will be easiest to maintain?
The case style and the implementation using guard clauses are different
from control structures in most other languages. If you feel that one of
these was the best implementation, can you think of ways to remind
yourself to investigate these options as you write Elixir code in the future?
