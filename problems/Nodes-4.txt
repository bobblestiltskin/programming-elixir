Exercise: Nodes-4
The ticker process in this chapter is a central server that sends events to
registered clients. Reimplement this as a ring of clients. A client sends a
tick to the next client in the ring. After 2 seconds, that client sends a tick
to its next client.
When thinking about how to add clients to the ring, remember to deal
with the case where a client’s receive loop times out just as you’re adding
a new process. What does this say about who has to be responsible for
updating the links?
