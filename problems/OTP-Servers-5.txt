Exercise: OTP-Servers-5
Implement the terminate callback in your stack handler. Use IO.puts to report
the arguments it receives.
Try various ways of terminating your server. For example, popping an
empty stack will raise an exception. You might add code that calls
System.halt(n) if the push handler receives a number less than 10. (This will
let you generate different return codes.) Use your imagination to try differ-
ent scenarios.
